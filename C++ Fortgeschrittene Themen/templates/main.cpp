/**
 * Reasons for returning by const reference:
 *  * If T is a 'complex type' (e.g., a fat class), that returning by value would incur extra cost
 *    in terms of memory and time for copying either t1 or t2. 
 *    Additionally, some classes may not even support copying (see lecture slides).
 *  * It would also be possible to return by pointer-to-const here, but using a reference 
 *    (i) is more convenient for the caller, (ii) asserts that the return value is non-null
 *  * The return value cannot be non-const because the parameters are both const.
